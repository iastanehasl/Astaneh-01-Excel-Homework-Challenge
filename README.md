In this activity, the analyst is asked to manipulate a large set of data involving KickStarter Campaigns across different countries, categories, and sub-categories. Three pivot tables were created to showcase the "state" (successful, failed, canceled, and live) by category, sub-category, and month. The analyst was then asked to interpret the data by adding additional columns to draw any meaningful conclusions. Bonus activities are included: using formulas to calculate ranges and data variablility.
